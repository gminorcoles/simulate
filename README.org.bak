Simulate is a package for simulating and optimizing multi-period investment.

Simulate is a python library for portfolio optimization and simulation. It is written in Python, its major dependencies are cvxpy and pandas.

The simulator is able to simulate the evolution of a portfolio, taking into account asset returns, transaction costs, and holding costs. The package includes simple but reasonable models of transaction cost based on asset bid-ask spread, volume, and volatility.

I consider a basic model of multi-period trading, which can be used to evaluate the performance of a trading strategy. We describe a framework for single-period optimization, where the trades in each period are found by solving a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk, transaction costs.

# todo
# holding costs such as the borrowing cost for shorting assets.

Simulate provides functionality for implementing trading strategies using the convex optimization package CVXPY.

The package relies on Pandas for data handling (e.g., prices, returns, volumes). Our simple examples show how Quandl can be used to import open source financial data, but any other source can be used instead.

See the examples for basic usage.

QP is a subclass of QCQP, so as one would imagine, it is more difficult to solve QCQP, but luckily CVXOPT is up to the task after we convert the QCQP into an even more general class of optimization problems - second-order cone programs (SOCP).
**** QCQPs to SOCPs
CVXOPT does not have an explicit solver for QCQPs, rather we must convert the QCQP to a SOCP, or one could also convert it to a semidefinite program (SDP), which is more general than a SOCP.

*** 3种模式：
Portfolios are points from a feasible set of assets that constitute an asset universe. A portfolio specifies either holdings or weights in each individual asset in the asset universe. The convention is to specify portfolios in terms of weights, although the portfolio optimization tools work with holdings as well.
The set of feasible portfolios is necessarily a nonempty, closed, and bounded set. The proxy for risk is a function that characterizes either the variability or losses associated with portfolio choices. The proxy for return is a function that characterizes either the gross or net benefits associated with portfolio choices. The terms "risk" and "risk proxy" and "return" and "return proxy" are interchangeable. The fundamental insight of Markowitz (see Portfolio Optimization) is that the goal of the portfolio choice problem is to seek minimum risk for a given level of return and to seek maximum return for a given level of risk. Portfolios satisfying these criteria are efficient portfolios and the graph of the risks and returns of these portfolios forms a curve called the efficient frontier.

***** Second Order Cone Programming with CVXOPT
CVXOPT is a convex optimization package for Python that includes a Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) solver.  The SOCP solver takes a set of matrices that describe the SOCP problem, but these matrices are different than the matrices usually used to express the SOCP problem.  This post walks through the simple algebra steps to find relationship between the two formulations of the SOCP problem.

The SOCP problem as described in Wikipedia or the excellent free book Convex Optimization by Boyd and Vandenberghe includes the constraint:
$\| A x + b \|_2 \leq c^T x + d$

We can rewrite this to be:

\begin{bmatrix} c^T \\ A \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} d \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} s_0 \\ s_1 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad s_0 \geq \| s_1 \|_2

Now to rearrange into the format expected by the CVXOPT solver:

- \begin{bmatrix} c^T \\ A \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} s_0 \\ s_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} d \\ b \end{bmatrix}

And then see the relationship between the two formulations of the SOCP problem are equivalent:

G= \begin{bmatrix} -c^T \\ -A \end{bmatrix} and h = \begin{bmatrix}d \\ b \end{bmatrix}

*** Portfolio Problem Specification
To specify a portfolio optimization problem, you need the following:

- Proxy for portfolio return (μ)
- Proxy for portfolio risk (Σ)
- Set of feasible portfolios (X), called a portfolio set

*** 多种限制条件：
- 个股数量限制；
- 个股权重限制；
- 行业权重限制；
- 风格因子暴露限制。
当未输入限制条件时，默认权重限制为（0，1），默认风格因子暴露为RISK MODEL计算得到的值上下浮动0.000009。

*** 不同的警告提示：
当输入的限制条件无法使得系统得出目标最优解时，会提示原因，找到何种限制条件无法满足。

FS由FD搭建。
- Function Sampling Define, Function Sampling Instance.
也可以通过把FSD绑定参数，产生FSI。
- Function Queue, Function Queue Instance.
当FS跑出大量FSI之后，需要设置筛选条件来取出符合要求的FSI，这个时候需要设定FQ，同时通过FQI来取目标FSI。
